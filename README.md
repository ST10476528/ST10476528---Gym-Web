- Ensured **equal spacing**, alignment, and clean section division
- Locked fixed widths to **prevent layout shifting** across screen sizes

###  Enhanced Typography and Spacing
- Applied `font-weight: bold` and increased size for hero sections
- Used consistent padding, `gap`, and `line-height` to improve readability
- Ensured spacing stayed tight and visually clean, especially on:
  - **Trainer cards**
  - **Shop products**
  - **About Us paragraphs**

###  Created Visual Emphasis
- Added **hover effects** for interactivity
- Implemented **gold and orange CTAs** for clear click-throughs
